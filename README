         Calmar's Picture Resizer, Version 0.4
         Resize/convert/rotate your pictures with this 
        
         --> Imagemagick's convert Frontend <--
        
         The calmar picture resizer checks before is overwrites
         anything - so it's quite safe.
         Nevertheless, use it at your own risk.

         PLEASE: report bugs. they will not be hard to fix
         probably, but I would have to know them.
