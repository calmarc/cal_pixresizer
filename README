         Calmar's Picture Resizer, Version 0.75 (beta)
         Resize/convert/rotate/edit your pictures with this 
         --> Imagemagick's convert Frontend <--
         additoinally add/edit Exif comments (jhead)

         The calmar picture resizer checks before is
         overwrites anything - so it's quite safe.
         Nevertheless, use it at your own risk.
